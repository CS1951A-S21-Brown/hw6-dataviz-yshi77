                <h4>Written Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>For Question 1, the boss wants to know the top 10 video games of all time. 
                            So I decided to sort all the video games by their global sales of all time first, and 
                            then I take the top 10 video games. In the bar chart, I display each name with its corresponding 
                            global sales in millions.
                            <br/>
                            For Question 2, the boss would like to understand which genre is most popular. So I display genre 
                            sales broken out per region using the grouped bar chart. In the graph, all the data is divided into 
                            four big categories/regions (e.g. NA, EU, JP, Other). In each region, I sum the regional sales per genre, 
                            and I display it. In each region, there are 12 genres. So there are 12 bars per region as displayed. By 
                            looking at this graph, I believe the boss can easily understand which genre is most popular in that region.
                            <br/>
                            For Question 3, it is an interactive Pie graph. As you can see, there is a dropdown list containing all the genres.
                            By selecting the genre you are interested in, it will dynamically display a pie graph that displays the top five
                            publishers for that genre. In addition, the pie graph shows the percentage of global sales for each of the top five publishers.
                            Hence, the boss would know which publisher to pick based on which genre a game is by using the graph 3.

                            1) First and foremost, it is web-based. Data visualizations are only useful if they can be seen easily. 
                            There's no better way to look for them than online.
                            <br/>
                            2) Its adaptability and flexibility are another explanation why it has performed so well. By integrating
                             seamlessly with current web technologies, it can modify any aspect of the document object model. 
                             It has a lot of benefits as a result of this.
                            <br/>
                            3) There are no pre-built charts to stifle innovation. Rather, it has tools that make linking data and graphics quick. 
                            It's in the middle of the two. It's an ideal location for data visualization.

                        <p>
                            1) For large numbers of entries, DOM manipulation can be extremely slow. When dealing with large numbers of components, SVG has performance limitations.
                            <br/>
                            2) D3.js is a JavaScript library for data-driven document manipulation. D3.js necessitates at least a basic understanding of Javascript, which may not be good for code beginners.
                            <br/>
                            3) It has a lower level of support than paid tools. For example, in this assignment, different versions of d3 cause me a lot of trouble, and I take a lot of time to debug.

                            I am referring to the first reading. The color blind people may find this dashboard accessible as I have tried many sets of colors 
                            for my graphs to achieve a better data visualization. To be honest, I am a color-blind people, 
                            and I am not very sensitive for some colors. A good set of colors is really essential for me to 
                            understand the graph. So I put extra efforts on finding a good set of colors that make color blind
                            people accessible. In addition, I implemented the tooltip that will benefit some people with vision problems.
                            However, blind people may have difficulty with my dashboard as I did not use 
                            alt text to provide a one-sentence summary of the chart. The blind people may find it hard to understand 
                            my graphs. In terms of the additional actions, I might add more alt text to describe the graph, which will
                            be useful to a screen reader and benefit more people.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            At the stages of designing my dashboard, I did consider making my dashboard more accessible to 
                            blind people. I could have made a feature that the Pie/Bar chart will describe the graph when the mouse
                            is hovering on the graph. However, there are some factors that kept me from taking these steps. One of 
                            major factors is my bad coding skills. I am not good at JavaScript. Hence, I am not able to implement this 
                            feature.
